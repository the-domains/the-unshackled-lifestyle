  Abraham Twerski made a great comparison. How do lobsters grow? The lobster is
  mostly a soft creature with a very hard exoskeleton which is static. As the
  lobster grows the exoskeleton becomes very restrictive creating pressure and
  preventing any further growth. The lobster will then seek shelter, break free
  from his exoskeleton and produce another one.
