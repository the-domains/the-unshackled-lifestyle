  "Beauty and seduction are nature's tools for survival because we protect what
  we fall in love with. It opens our hearts and makes us realize we are a part
  of nature and we're not separate from it. When we see ourselves in nature, it
  also connects us to every one of us, because it's clear that it's all
  connected in one.
